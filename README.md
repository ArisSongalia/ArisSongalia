**Hi there **👋
I'm Aris Songalia, based in Cavite, Philippines, aspiring to become a great Software Engineer 🧑‍💻.

🔭 Currently working on a full-stack web application built with React, Firebase, and MongoDB Atlas.

🌱 Actively learning full-stack software development for both desktop and mobile platforms.

💻 Currently exploring JavaScript, Python, Java, and Go (Golang), along with frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue, Angular, Django, and Express.

👯 Open to collaborating on dynamic, multi-device applications — especially those with a touch of AI/ML.

💬 Feel free to reach out for collaborations and opportunities.
